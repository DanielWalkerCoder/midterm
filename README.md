Midterm Assignment: Full-Stack CRUD Application
Overview
This midterm assignment involves developing a full-stack web application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing a dataset, with a backend handling data persistence and business logic. The project is organized into two separate repositories: one for the frontend and another for the backend.

Repositories
Frontend Repository: https://github.com/DanielWalkerCoder/midterm-frontend
Backend Repository: https://github.com/DanielWalkerCoder/midterm-backend
Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
React
Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Other:
Git for version control
Postman for API testing
[Additional tools/libraries as needed]
Features
CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new items to the dataset
Read: View existing items
Update: Modify existing items
Delete: Remove items from the dataset

Responsive Design:
Application must look the part. Consider adding CSS libraries to your projects like bootstrap or material ui.

\*\*\*Stretch Goals
Consider making the website responsive for various widow sizes.
Build out your back end to include more features like sorting or filters.

- AI Use
  I would like you all to refrain from the use of AI for this project.
  There is a time and place to use AI as a time saving tool, but that
  time is not during the learning of your craft. If you need help with
  a portion of your project or don't understand something, definitely reach
  out for clarity. You are all here to learn and the simple mistakes are
  a big part of that!

We will present these projects on August 5th.
